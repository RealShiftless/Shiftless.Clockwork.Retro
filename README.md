# Shiftless.Clockwork.Retro
This is a lightweight graphics framework, inspired by old school consoles like the Gameboy and Gameboy Advance.
I need to write up more about it later, as currently it's still in very early development. 
It's being developed alongside my current game [DemoRogue](https://github.com/RealShiftless/DemoRogue).
